## SnapCraft

Thanks to [mharjac](https://github.com/mharjac)

Termshark can be easily installed on almost all major distros just by issuing: 

```bash
snap install termshark
```

After installation, it requires some additional permissions:

```bash
snap connect termshark:network-control
snap connect termshark:bluetooth-control
snap connect termshark:firewall-control
snap connect termshark:ppp
snap connect termshark:raw-usb
snap connect termshark:removable-media
```

## Termux (Android)

```bash
pkg install root-repo
pkg install termshark
```
Note that termshark does not require a rooted phone to inspect a pcap, but it does depend on tshark which is itself in Termux's root-repo for programs that do work best on a rooted phone.

If you would like to use termshark's copy-mode to copy sections of packets to your Android clipboard, you will also need [Termux:API](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux.api&hl=en_US). Install from the Play Store, then from termux, type:

```bash
pkg install termux-api
```
